          Hello! My name is Nkaujhnub, but I like to go by 'Nunu'. I am studying Cybersecurity at Wake Technical Community College and may possibly dabble a little bit into Networking down the road. Before Wake Tech, I was at NC State studying Business IT, but made the ultimate decision to transfer in hopes of being in a better environment that best suits my learning style while pursuing my education goals. Prior to living in Raleigh, I lived in Wadesboro, NC where I was dualy enrolled at&nbsp; South Piedmont Community College during my highschool years.</p>

                Growing up I grew familiar with entrepreneurship and various business ideas as my parents owned their own small business; 109 Farms without even realizing it. Every Saturday, we would travel up from Wadesboro to Raleigh to sell vegetables at the State Farmer's Market where I picked up a lot of my social networking and soft skills while providing products and services to customers. However at home during the weekdays--and especially during Summer break, I learned the significance of inventory management, supply-chain, and some of the 'behind-the-scenes' of running a business.

             It was not until college that I realized these skills that I seemed to have naturally picked up from working with my parents are crucical business fundamentals. Despite the on-hands experience that I received, I knew for sure that business alone is not what I had in mind for my future. It did not take me long to find a passion in technology as I was an avid gamer while growing up.<br>
             <br>
          I fondly remember nostalgic moments of playing videos games on consoles like the Nintendo Cube, Nintendo Wii, and even the Nintendo DS alongside my siblings during times away from the fields and the Farmer's Market. As I grew older and more and more of my siblings left the house, I found myself playing more single-player oriented games where I was the one in control. It was fascinating to see what technology brought to us tangibly, despite stemming from such an abstract world. Although it took me awhile to grasp my head behind the basics of what makes technology viable, it only makes me wonder "<em>What is the next thing that technology will be able to do?</em>" </p>
